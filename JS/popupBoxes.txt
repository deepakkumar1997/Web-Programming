Javascript has three kind of popup boxes :
    > Alert Box
    > Confirm Box
    > Prompt Box

Alert Box:
> When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "ok" to proceed.
> Syntax ; alert("Message");
> alert() is window's object member function so we can use window.alert() as well.
> Simply alert() will also work.
> alert() is used when we have to tell something to the user.

Confirm Box:
> It is used to take confirmation from the user.
> When confirm box pops up the user will have to click either ok or cancel to proceed.
> If user clicks ok then box returns true otherwise false
> Syntax : confirm("Message");

Prompt Box:
> A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.
> When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "ok" or "cancel" to proceed 
  after entering an input value.
> If the user clicks "ok" the box returns the inputed value. If the user clicks "cancel" the box
  returns null;
> Syntax: prompt("Message", "default value");
